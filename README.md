# Decision Analytics Project on Optimizing Herbicide Application in Corn Cultivation

## Project Overview

### Background
The use of glyphosate, a widely-used herbicide in America’s farmlands, has been a topic of intense debate due to its classification as a probable human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IRAC) since 2015. Despite the ongoing controversy, the usage of glyphosate has increased significantly, presenting a critical challenge: balancing agricultural productivity with environmental protection.

### Objective
This project aims to optimize glyphosate usage, along with other herbicides, to maintain environmental sustainability in key agricultural regions of the United States.

### Focus Areas
We concentrate on Iowa, Illinois, and Nebraska - the states with the highest herbicide usage in the US. Our localized approach ensures a comprehensive understanding of herbicide dynamics in these areas, aligning with our goal of reducing herbicide overuse while maintaining major crop yields.

## Methodology

### Core Approach
Our project employs a combination of mathematical modeling and optimization techniques, integrated through data analysis. This approach is geared towards developing strategies that balance reduced use of harmful herbicides with the need for increasing yields in vital crops like corn.

### Stakeholder Benefits
1. **Consumers**: Ensuring safer, healthier produce by mitigating risks associated with herbicide exposure.
2. **Agricultural Community**: Supporting farmers by fostering sustainable practices, preserving crop yields, and reducing financial burdens.
3. **Government and Regulatory Bodies**: Providing data-driven insights to inform balanced regulations, addressing both agricultural needs and environmental conservation.

## Impact and Significance
Our project transcends agricultural boundaries, promising significant benefits for societal well-being, environmental stewardship, and the sustainability of American agriculture through innovative optimization techniques.
