    <td colspan="4">COMMENTS: Provides grass suppression while controlling numerous broadleaves, including ducksalad. Provides residual activity up to 40 days and can be tank-mixed with several other herbicides to increase weed control spectrum. Apply into static water to prevent movement of the herbicide and loss of weed control. Areas most likely to lose weed control following the application of this herbicide are in uppermost basins or around rice boxes where water has been allowed to flow. Water depth is less important than holding the water static. If water depth subsides before 5 days, water can be added but some loss of weed control may occur where water movement is greatest. If rice is poorly rooted because of wind or other damage, allow it ample time to anchor before using bensulfuron, otherwise rice root development may be delayed. May be applied as a spray solution or as a direct dry flowable product. Sprays are applied with conventional booms and the dry flowable formulation by precision low volume metering equipment, both by aircraft. Do not use on wild rice. </td>

Best results are obtained when very fine granules or crystals are dropped into the floodwater; or when the copper sulfate is dissolved in water and sprayed. Apply treatments as the algae forms on the soil surface and organic matter and air pockets are beginning to form under the algae (causing it to start to rise to the surface of the water and float). Once the algae have floated to the surface and formed large mats, control is very difficult. Fields irrigated from wells often have algae problems and should be watched carefully. Hard water (excess carbonate) will tend to negate the effects of copper sulfate. Copper sulfate rates of 6.8 to 13.6 lb with 48-hour water-holding period for control of freshwater algae is allowed under a Special Local Needs label (EPA SLN No. CA-130013), which expires December 31, 2023.</td>

    <td colspan="4">COMMENTS: A contact herbicide that controls an array of weeds such as watergrass, barnyardgrass, sedges, while suppressing sprangletop and other broadleaf weeds. Early treatments control watergrass more effectively; however, application generally must be delayed 35 to 50 days after seeding to control emerged broadleaf weeds. This allows adequate time for broadleaf weeds to develop sufficient foliage. If earlier watergrass control is desired under these conditions, a postplant treatment of thiobencarb is recommended. Can be applied by either ground or air in 10 to 15 gallons of water. Use higher volume to get better coverage and control of large grasses or dense weed populations. Use the low rate on young watergrass (30–35 days after seeding) in very shallow water to assure good coverage of the weed. Use the high rate when most watergrass is 6 to 9 inches above the water. Leaf injury (tip burn) may occur on rice when the temperature is above 85° to 90°F at the time of the application. <b>Do not use propanil within 14 days of an application of a carbamate (such as carbaryl) or organophosphate (such as malathion).</b> (Exception: Low dosages of insecticide as used for mosquito larva control in rice fields may be applied 5 days before or after application of propanil.) </td>

    <td colspan="4">COMMENTS: Mostly used for grass control but also provides some control of smallflower umbrella sedge and selected broadleaf weeds. Abolish may be applied preflood to fields that are immediately flooded, however, the effective residual period after flooding is considerably short. Both Abolish 8 EC and Bolero UltraMax may be applied after the crop has emerged, but the window for rice safety and weed control is very narrow. Because timing of thiobencarb to weeds and rice is so important, the following situations should be avoided: fields that take longer than 5 days to flood and fields with greater than 0.2-foot fall to avoid deep-water stress. Use caution when using dry coated seed because it delays germination, which narrows the application window by allowing watergrass to become too large while rice is still in the sensitive stage. Make postplant application when 70% of the rice seedlings have reached the 2-leaf stage. Rice is very sensitive to these formulations at the one-leaf stage and may be severely injured if it is applied too early. Thiobencarb provides residual activity of about 25 days. It will not be effective on watergrass or barnyardgrass beyond the 3-leaf stage. <b>Do not use within 14 days of an application of a carbamate (such as carbaryl) or organophosphate (such as malathion). Note:</b> Check with agricultural commissioner for water-holding requirements following all thiobencarb applications. Do not make more than one application per year. </td>

If rice is poorly rooted because of wind or other damage, allow it ample time to anchor before using, otherwise rice root development may be delayed. Do not use on wild rice. </td>
