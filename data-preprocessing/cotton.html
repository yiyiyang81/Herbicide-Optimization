    <td colspan="4">COMMENTS: A soil fumigant used for preplant control of annual broadleaves (including nightshade) and grasses; provides partial control of perennials. Nutsedge control is erratic on sandy soils and poor on clay loam soils. Prepare a firm, trash- and clod-free seedbed and preirrigate the soil to ensure that weed seeds have imbibed water. Soil temperatures should be between 50° and 90°F. Use a shallow 6- to 8-inch spray blade to apply a band on top of the cotton bed. Nutsedge control is improved with a 2-3 tiered spray blade or using staggered fertilizer knives. Cover or cap with a 2- to 3-inch layer of soil; place the material deep enough so that treated soil will not be disturbed by the planting operation. Planting may take place 14–21 days after treatment, depending on amount applied as indicated on label. Be sure not to contaminate treated soil with untreated soil during planting or subsequent cultivations. Best results are obtained if soil is undisturbed between application and planting. Apply preplant fertilizer before the metam sodium. Yield reduction can occur because of the reduction of mycorrhizal fungi in the soil; the addition of phosphorus fertilizer has helped correct this problem. Either tank mix the phosphorus with metam or apply it at planting.</td>

Applications, which may also be applied as a postdirected spray<sup>3</sup>, can be made anytime after the cotton has reached the first visible true leaf; weeds should be in the seedling stage and actively growing. Pyrithiobac sodium causes temporary yellowing, bronzing, or crinkling of cotton leaves when applied over the top<sup>2</sup>, especially under cool conditions. Symptoms are more evident and remain longer in Pima cotton than in Acala cottons. Plantback intervals for pyrithiobac sodium include: tomatoes 8 months; wheat 6 months; and cotton anytime. All other crops require a minimum of 10 months and a field bioassay. Double disc or plow fields before planting.</td>
